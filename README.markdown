# SigmaSQL

A SQL helper library, currently only running on top of
[emysql](https://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql), but with the intention of
eventually running on top a PostgreSQL driver as well.

## What it does

It provides a simple layer on top of existing SQL drivers, abstracting away the
pool management, and providing sensible default behaviors.  Further, it
provides a whole slew of methods for returning and updating data: lists,
tuples, proplists, dicts, existence checks, single fields returning and
setting, updating data from proplists, and more.
